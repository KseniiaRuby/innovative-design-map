        "projectDescription": "The forms of the water structures and landforms are inspired by natural river morphology as well as hydrologic and sedimentation processes. O2 and S2S sculpted polishing marshes and wet meadows, their forms inspired by anabranches or river scrolls. The scrolling forms in the landscape enhance filtration, create diverse habitats, and provide more depth to store water when necessary. The network of pathways and boardwalks mimic and contrast these forms: visitors can read the river’s story over time. The final outflow stream discharges to an important trout habitat area, designed to serve as refuge during river flood conditions.",

Structured around a series of designed aquatic and upland habitats, the flow of water within the park begins in the upstream residential communities where runoff travels through pipes before daylighting in the park. The aquatic journey within the park expresses the integration of water engineering, public art, landscape architecture and ecological design.",

        "projectDescription": "The initial investment in Dale Hodges Park was made in 2010 when The City acquired the land from Klippert Concrete. As part of The City's ongoing commitment to environmental sustainability, the ecological integrity of the area was restored while enhancing the park's recreational and educational values. What was once a contaminated gravel pit has now been remediated and transformed into a functional, natural space that not only treats stormwater, but can be enjoyed and explored by Calgarians for generations to come.",
