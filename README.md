# EvolveU - P3 - Innovative Design Mapping

<img src="https://github.com/navinjetha/innovative-design-map/blob/master/client/src/images/Calgary_DT.jpg" width="600">

An in-class proof-of-concept, skills-building exercise to construct the framework for a database structuring and digital mapping communication tool for design innovation projects in Calgary. This is a mobile application built using `React`, `Mapbox-GL`, `node`, `Express JS`, `MongoDB Atlas` and other technologies.

### Requirements

This project was built in JavaScript with `node v14.16.0`, and tested in the latest public version of Chrome.

### Installation

This version requires little additional config to run:

- In a new folder, from your Terminal.app, `git clone https://github.com/navinjetha/innovative-design-map.git`
- Change to the current release branch: `git checkout master`
- In both the `/server` and `/client` folder, run `npm install` - to download dependencies and configure
- Finally, in both the `/server` and `/client` folders, run `npm start` - to start the servers

Your server will now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). From the browser, begin.
